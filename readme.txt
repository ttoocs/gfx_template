Assignment 5.


Sadly: Incomplete.

The scene graph: Due to the simplicity, of the 3 body (4 with skysphere), you can arrange the scene graph as an array, where each successive element depends on the prior.


Was working on orbits, there is a logical error in how I'm using my scene graph to make the moon orbit the earth. Furthermore, I make no attempt at oribital inclinations, as even perfect ones are currently broken.


Shadows were never implemented. However the textures were.


Mostly helped by reverse-engineering Jeremy's code.


//KEYS//

E/Q moves up/down (Spherical)
W/S move in/out
A/D move left/right (Spherical)

Z/X slowdown/speed up simulation.

P		stop simulation.

//Mouse movement:
Click and drag!
